Welcome to the BAC Calculator!

There are two calculators, one is a normal BAC calculator using standard drink sizes, (14g of alcohol per drink), while the other calculator you can input a specific drink size
in ml and then the drink's ABV. BAC will be calculated after these processes and you can see if you are under the legal limit to drive or not!

How It Works

You’ll be asked for your weight in pounds. Yes, your weight—not the weight of your emotional baggage or your dog. Also, it must be a positive number, because believe it or not, negative pounds aren’t a thing.

Declare your gender. Only the two biological options please!

Enter how many hours you've been drinking. 

From here you either add how many drinks you've had or specific drink details one drink at a time depending on what calculator you chose! 

Finally the calculator will spit out your BAC.
